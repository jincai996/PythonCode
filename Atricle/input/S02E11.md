The Vice President just entered the Department of Justice.
We're here with Ayla Sayyad,
whose Wall Street Telegraph article
catalyzed the investigation. Ayla.
The issue at stake is
whether the White House was in any way involved.
Was foreign money traded for political favors?
Did it influence diplomatic relations?
Just the act of laundering Chinese contributions is illegal.
If it had a significant impact on White House policy,
that's a far more serious crime.
You've met with Daniel Lanagin on multiple occasions.
We were in the same room, yes, on 11 occasions since 2003.
But we only spoke on three of those occasions.
Those instances are highlighted.
What did you discuss?
Well, these were fundraisers.
I speak to dozens of people,
usually about nothing at all.
I'm southern, Ms. Dunbar.
My mother taught me that
conversation during mealtime is not only polite,
it aids the digestive process.
So you didn't speak to him
about the Adohi tribe's contributions to any of these super PACs?
Absolutely not.
I never discuss super PACs with any supporters.
We both know the law.
During one of these polite conversations,
do you recall Mr. Lanagin ever mentioning Xander Feng?
I do not.
Does that name mean anything to you?
Other than being plastered all over the news?
In that regard it means as much as Kim Kardashian.
Then let me be more specific.
What knowledge do you have of Mr. Feng's political activities?
Is this coming from your husband, or is it...?
From me.
And it's not that I don't support the bill anymore.
It's just the article.
We've promised Matt an interview.
Maybe in a few weeks,
once the investigation has died down.
The New York Times isn't going to wait for us.
They've already scheduled the cover for October.
Based on our timing --
Then I can't be a part of it.
It's the Galloway nonsense, isn't it?
Claire, come on.
It's okay.
You can say so. We're friends.
It doesn't help.
You don't actually believe I --
No.
But enough of the country still does.
And Garrett needs every bit of support he can get right now.
So there's no convincing you?
I'll help as much as I can.
Quietly.
There are rumors that you and Mr. Feng
served as back channels to the trade summit last May.
Exactly. Rumors.
We have Feng in the U.S. during the summit.
Well, if he was back-channeling,
and even if I were aware,
any form of diplomatic communication is usually classified.
Have you ever discussed Feng with the President?
Any major player in Beijing is worthy of discussion.
So that's a yes.
It's a general comment.
Did you discuss him during the energy crisis?
I assuming you're alluding to the refinery co-venture with --
Yes. With Raymond Tusk.
The refinery was never part of our conversation.
We needed an immediate solution.
A refinery would have solved nothing in the short term.
And it's my understanding that deal fell through.
Correct. But Tusk did receive a subsidy.
As did every other nuclear energy provider.
But his connection with Feng,
then a subsidy on samarium --
Nobody made any profits off these subsidies.
At best they were breaking even.
In fact, Raymond fought us on the issue.
Then let's back up to the Port Jefferson Bridge.
I don't blame her. It's a valid concern.
Tell him I won't engage on Galloway,
so there's no point in asking.
This is Matt Bai.
We can't dictate what he'll ask.
And he will ask.
Well, then I'll just say I won't answer tabloid questions.
It's a legitimate question.
How the scandal could affect the vote.
Look, I say you pull out, too.
We scrap the whole piece.
Jackie is fighting us.
The leadership is noncommittal.
We need this article to refocus attention.
But it'll hurt you.
Both your personal image and the bill.
But if we cut the cord,
we schedule two interviews,
then we cancel, won't Matt be furious?
The story will be about pulling out.
We're talking about the lesser of two evils.
I don't want you to become the target,
to undo all the work --
Then what if it's not me at all?
But you said the first lady wasn't going --
Not her. Someone else.
Was the bridge a trade-off to prevent additional GOP funding?
As far as I know,
the bridge was a delivery on a promise
the president had made to the voters.
Are we finished here?
Almost.
How many members of Congress have you interviewed, Ms. Dunbar?
About 200?
194.
Well, I want to be of help,
but I doubt I can offer any more than the 194 that preceded me.
I have gotten some useful testimony.
From who?
A high-ranking House member.
In the leadership?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Bob Birch? Jackie Sharp?
This individual says he attended a meeting
July 14th in the Oval Office.
She said "He,"
so it must have been Birch.
I'm sure Raymond had no trouble buying him off.
You attended that meeting also.
It appears so.
Do you recall the subject of that meeting?
A wave of conservative attack ads.
We were being outspent.
It must have been quite a shock
when Lanagin's tribe shifted contributions to the other party,
when they hadn't given a single dime to the Republicans before that.
Well, it would have been a shock,
but we didn't know where the money was coming from at the time.
According to my source...
Bob Birch.
My source says the estimate was 25 million.
You said, and I quote,
"With this kind of influx,
you can be sure somebody isn't playing by the rules."
Sounds like something I might say.
Bob has a better memory than me.
The money stopped just after
the Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.
Is there a theory here,
or are you just grasping at straws?
The bridge leads to Feng.
Feng gives me Lanagin and Tusk.
Tusk and the president --
Ms. Dunbar, you want to play six degrees of separation,
you could throw in Jimmy Hoffa and the pope.
Then how about one degree of separation?
Douglas Stamper, your chief of staff.
This is him at Lanagin's casino July 14th.
I used these to get a warrant for flight records.
The next day, Mr. Stamper was on a flight to Beijing.
Why was he at the casino?
And why was he in Beijing?
I would like to speak to my client.
Please.
I work hard.
I keep things simple.
I know what my priorities are.
But there's this -- this person.
She's not even in my life, except on the edges,
making things blurrier.
It doesn't tempt me to drink.
It's more like she --
it's more like she feels what it was like when I was drinking.
When I couldn't get enough.
No matter how many drinks I had,
I wanted another.
I -I don't want to be with her.
I mean, I -I -I do.
But
it's more like she's my daughter.
Or my mother.
I don't know. This is fucked up.
Take your time.
I should cut her off.
The way I did with booze.
That's all. I'm done.
Thanks for sharing.
We'll need some time before responding to your questions.
I could wait as long as necessary.
It could take a while.
There are national security matters at stake.
The vice president needs to consult with his advisors.
National security?
Are you really gonna play that card, Oliver?
His answers could entail classified material.
When can we expect a response?
I'll let you know.
May we hold onto the screen cap?
Be my guest.
We'll be in touch soon, Ms. Dunbar.
Mr. Vice President?
If you think you're insulated, don't.
Our investigation is much bigger than Douglas Stamper.
That's enough, Ms. Dunbar.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Vice President.
Happy to cooperate.
From the lion's den to a pack of wolves.
When you're fresh meat, kill,
and throw them something fresher.
Hey, I'm Fitz.
Doug.
Yeah, you know, uh, you can isolate,
white-knuckle this shit if you want.
Or you can ask for help.
Got a sponsor?
No. It's been 14 years. I'm good.
Number's on the back, if you change your mind.
Thought you had a driver.
I do.
I didn't want him overhearing anything.
You shouldn't even be near this state.
I'm not really here.
Long layover on my way to California.
I've got auditors,
federal agents in my office,
going through every file, every document.
They're going through my god damn trash.
Just stick to the Fifth if she subpoenas you.
Well, how do they know to look for Stamper?
To search the tapes on that exact day?
Don't jump to conclusions.
You're throwing me under the bus.
Underwood's the roadkill. Not you.
They're going to fuck me.
They'll find a way.
And you know that.
And if that's the case,
you and your family will be taken care of.
They're already offering me a plea.
You haven't even been charged yet.
If I cooperate.
You'll do less time,
but your family will have nothing.
They'll still have nothing when you get out.
You testify against Raymond,
and he'll still walk
because all they'll have is your word.
And that doesn't count for much right now.
You wouldn't be here if he wasn't afraid.
I'm not here because he's afraid.
I'm here because you are.
And I want to make sure you don't do anything stupid.
After repeated conversations with Beijing
they remain intractable in their position.
This morning I gave orders for a carrier group
to reposition near Okinawa.
This won't put our ships in direct confrontation
with the Chinese vessels,
but it will put them within reach of airstrikes.
I'll be informing the Chinese ambassador later today.
We'll release a statement in coordination with the Pentagon.
Sir, our stockpiles of samarium
will only last another two months at most.
If we go this route --
Yeah, I've -I've heard everyone's concerns.
And this is the decision I've made.
Any questions?
Okay. Thank you.
Frank.
How'd it go?
We have a few follow-up questions that we have to address.
Like what?
Oh, nothing major.
Just odds and ends. A few details.
I was under the impression this would be short and sweet.
So was I, but she's very deliberate.
We need this over, Frank.
At least as far as the White House is concerned.
We can't be distracted.
Not with warships on the move.
I'm confident we're in the home stretch.
Well, you seem more concerned than you're letting on.
Oh, no, not at all.
You're fidgeting.
It's my class ring.
I forget I --
I buried it.
You what?
I -- it's a long story.
I've never seen you this stressed before, Frank.
Well, I've never seen you this tired before, sir.
You've got rings of your own.
Dark ones.
Yeah, they're getting worse, aren't they?
You should take more naps on those sofas in the Oval.
Oh, naps don't cut it these days, Frank.
Not even a dent.
Lie after lie.
First to a prosecutor, then to a president.
I feel exposed.
Like the skin where my ring used to be.
Even Achilles was only as strong as his heel.
Where's Doug?
He's not answering his phone.
He went to a meeting, sir.
In the middle of the day?
I think he's on his way back now.
I want him back now as soon as possible.
Sir, this arrived for you.
The watch you gave Remy when he left for Glendon Hill.
I recognized it from the quote on the back.
Was there a message?
No. Just the watch.
Let's find Doug.
Right away, sir.
Forgive the plastic.
Luc Tuymans. He's the real thing.
Well, I'll take your word.
It's not mine. None of it.
California, you want to sell your house,
your realtor decorates it.
Well, one room at least.
Where you moving?
Oh, I have a little ranch in Sonoma.
My wife's gone.
My kids won't talk to me.
But at least I'll have my painting.
You paint?
No. And there's no ranch.
But the rest of it -- the rest of it's true.
Cheers.
I'm here about Jacqueline Sharp.
We're thinking of hiring her.
A lobbyist?
She could lose her re-elect.
Not a great time to be an incumbent.
I know you two are close.
So, you're looking for what?
A recommendation?
We have the lowest turnover of any shop on K Street.
There's a reason.
What are you looking for at Glendon Hill?
A killer instinct.
Well, she certainly has that.
Forgive me if I'm prying,
but did she have anything to do with your, uh...
Departure?
Jackie did what she had to do.
I'll never forgive her.
But I understand why she did it.
Did what exactly?
I paid cash for my ticket.
I was careful.
Clearly not enough.
Sir, the casino had cameras everywhere.
There was no way to avoid them.
But there had to have been thousands of hours of footage.
Now how they found that --
I have to ask you a question, Doug.
And I'm sorry, but I need you to be honest.
Are you drinking again?
God no.
Truly?
It's not an option.
Because it would explain a lot.
You have every right to be upset.
This was my fault.
I'm more concerned than I'm upset.
I need you now, Doug.
More than ever.
I know.
We're not young men.
If we fail, we'll die in a cage.
I haven't been myself lately.
That's what you said to me 14 years ago.
When I gave you a second chance, it paid off.
You got clean, Doug.
Nothing means more to me than this job, sir. Nothing.
Whatever's going on,
I need to know that it can be managed.
And if you need my help,
I'm here to help you.
I'm good, sir.
I can handle myself.
Things'll be different.
I've never given someone a third chance.
Until this very moment.
And I'm grateful.
You won't regret it.
Please believe that, sir.
It was Remy who alerted them to the footage.
His going-away gift.
Read the back.
What do you think he's trying to say?
I don't know,
but track him down and set up a meeting.
What about Dunbar?
We can't run from the facts.
I'll say whatever you want me to say.
I'll take responsibility for all of it.
She could indict you.
That's what having a staff is for.
I have a better solution.
We'll both take responsibility. How?
Set up an interview with Dunbar. Day after tomorrow.
You and I need time to do our homework. Yes, sir.
When did this happen?
Meechum helped me fix it.
If they're not gonna let me run, I have to work out some way.
You carried it all the way up here?
For privacy. I had help.
Meechum. That's right.
Well, he's a jack of all trades.
Handyman. Furniture mover. Human shield.
How bad is it?
Bad.
They have evidence of Doug being where he shouldn't have been.
What are you gonna do?
Tell the truth.
You're not actually gonna -- Selectively.
Don't worry.
It's a stumble, not a fall.
You aren't like this when it's just a stumble.
Like how? You're scared. I can tell.
500 meters at 1:39. That was my best.
Shoot for that.
How have you been?
Okay.
The meds are helping. Oh, that's good to hear.
Let's have a seat.
Those people at the end of the street...
it's intense.
They're there 24/7. Twice as many on the weekends.
We're so used to it by now.
Can I take off my shoes?
I thought I should dress up, but I am not good with heels.
Yes. Of course.
My mom said they went with the dress.
Much better.
Look, Megan,
I know the last six months have been difficult,
but I need your help.
We just don't have the support that we expected in the leadership.
Yeah, I figured this wasn't just about checking up on me.
You changed your mind before, and I understand why.
But now it seems as though things are more stable with you.
Are you willing?
It's hard to say no when I'm in your house.
Well, you hear those people out there.
They're loud, but I think we need to be louder.
And it can't be my voice,
because I'm the baby killer, the cheater.
It needs to be your voice.
A clear voice.
I'm already testifying at the court martial.
But that's closed to the media.
It's not enough.
There are so many people this has happened to.
Why does it have to be me?
Because you're the one who called.
Are you gonna try to put it out before McGinnis gets sentenced?
Seth? You have a minute?
Matt, I have to call you back.
Close the door.
When the vice president brought you on board,
I advised against it.
But I can't deny you've done a good job.
I appreciate you saying that.
I'm very protective of the vice president.
I find it hard to share that duty with anyone else,
which leaves me open to error.
It's one of my faults.
As I told the vice president,
I understand that trust is something that I need to earn.
And given how I got the job --
If the vice president trusts you, then I trust you.
We're a team now.
And the truth is I can't do this alone.
Anything and everything you ask of me.
It might have nothing to do with the media.
Press Secretary is just a title.
Good.
We have two tasks.
First, find me Remy Danton.
But be discreet.
I'll track him down.
Second, I need you to go
through the Vice President's travel logs.
Everything in the past 10 years.
What are we looking for?
Anything that could hurt us.
I'll work forward.
You work backward.
I'm on it. And Doug?
Thanks.
Nancy, I need you to order me a new phone.
You said "Odds and ends." The "Home stretch."
I was presented with this information just hours ago.
We're talking about impeachable offenses, Frank.
Not at all, sir.
Your Chief of Staff was --
I had a gut feeling that the casino was involved.
I sent Doug down there to get to the bottom of it.
You should have taken this to the DOJ the first inkling you had --
That's exactly what I didn't want.
To create some ruckus if nothing was going on?
You can't go on conducting your own investigations, Frank.
Fact-finding, due diligence,
whatever you want to call it.
If any laws were being broken, I wanted to know.
And that's what you want to tell Dunbar.
That I didn't want to disclose our diplomatic protocols.
That I was concerned about the midterms.
And that I wanted to protect the President of the United States.
Now, maybe what I did was wrong,
but I didn't do anything illegal.
You certain of that?
I've discussed this at length with my lawyers.
Dunbar does not strike me as the sort of person
who will put on the brakes, even if we admit all of this.
In fact, it might encourage her to dig deeper.
You're right.
Which is why I want to hand over all of my travel logs.
And I think you should, too.
Volunteer them?
Yeah. As a gesture of cooperation.
Haven't we made enough gestures?
That'll take the wind outta her sails.
No. I don't, uh, want her,
uh, poring over every one of my comings and goings.
He's worried about his marriage counseling,
as he should be.
If you're worried about your marriage counseling,
you shouldn't be.
Imagine the fallout if the public were to find out that --
A needle in a haystack,
and not a needle that Dunbar is looking for.
She's interviewed half of Congress.
That woman's after blood.
But not for gossip.
And even if she does raise an eyebrow,
you were visiting a sick friend, weren't you?
Yeah, ostensibly.
Well, she couldn't possibly find any fault with that.
I'd like Galich in here.
I'll let you two talk privately.
When are you seeing Dunbar?
Tomorrow, so you have some time.
Well, I'll speak to Bill and get back to you.
He'll advise you against it, which is his job.
But I would just encourage you
to think politics and not legalese.
Thank you, sir.
Congresswoman?
Why should I vote for you?
It's -- it's okay, Mark.
Goodnight.
You look tired.
Long day on the campaign trail?
What are you doing here?
You never told me about Havemeyer's daughter.
Everyone knows that.
The whole world knows.
But not that you visited her.
That you leaked it.
You came all the way to California to ask me about that?
I came to California to find out about that.
I offered to buy Havemeyer's house,
but he told me for nothing.
You were right.
It has been a long day on the trail.
It's still a close race.
But not if the voters know how you became whip.
Are you honestly threatening me?
Set up a meeting with Frank.
I don't care what you talk about,
long as you're alone and the meeting is on the books.
Then you're gonna sit down with Dunbar.
I've already done my interview.
Tell her Frank grilled you on your testimony.
Perjure myself?
Save your seat.
You know what? Tell everyone.
Think how that'd play out.
I don't care.
You'd really toss yourself off a cliff for Frank?
I have zero allegiance for Frank Underwood.
I won't be manipulated by him.
And I sure as fuck won't be manipulated by you.
I'm not bluffing.
Then I was right.
About what?
How little I meant.
That has nothing to do with this.
It has everything to do with this.
I should feel disgusted, but I don't.
Just supremely disappointed.
We got the call 10 minutes ago.
Direct from the White House counsel.
The President's turning over everything?
From the day he took office.
And we're sure this includes the visits to his friend?
It has to. It was full security detail.
Phenomenal.
We have something we can work with.
Now, as for my logs...
They're clean.
You'd bet your life on that?
I would.
Me, too, sir.
We've been through 'em twice,
backward and forward.
My statement?
In your inbox.
I looked it over. Seth did a nice job.
We need to go wide with this the moment the interview's over,
so that we beat Dunbar to the punch
in case she decides to release something.
I'll be at my computer,
ready to press "Send" the moment I hear from Doug.
Have either of you slept?
We're awake. Fully operational.
You take a shower and put on a fresh suit.
Yes, sir. I'll see you over there.
You have at least three hours.
Take a nap.
You can use my office.
General McGinnis was in the courtroom when you testified.
Yes.
Had you seen him in person --
I mean, since he assaulted you?
No.
So what was that like?
Not fun.
Not fun how?
It was hard. Really hard.
Look, Megan,
I -I agreed to change the focus of my piece to focus on you,
and, you know, I know this has gotta be hard.
I need you to help me out a little bit.
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this. I'm nervous.
You seemed fine when you called into Mrs. Underwood's interview.
She was there with me on the phone.
Your nerves.
I know that's been an issue since the assault.
The defense brought up
what they called emotional and mental instability.
That's what always happens.
The person who was attacked gets attacked all over again.
How did that make you feel?
It made me angry.
The lawyer kept coming after me about my panic attacks,
my antidepressants.
But I just kept staring at McGinnis.
I wanted him to see I could take it.
That I was strong.
I wanted to make him look away first.
And did he?
Yes. When I said he did more than violate my body.
He betrayed his country.
He robbed it of a good Marine.
Let's talk about the Sexual Assault Bill
that's in front of Congress right now.
You know it's taken some significant opposition,
most notably from another veteran,
Jacqueline Sharp.
If you ask me, she's betraying her country, too.
Ms. Dunbar.
Mr. Vice President.
Thank you for giving us a few extra days.
I have no problem being patient,
as long as it leads to forthright answers.
Well, I won't make you wait a moment longer.
Shall we?
Oh, you found it.
Have a seat.
We're just finishing up here.
What do you think, Mr. Tusk?
Keep growing it or have it shaved?
Ah, I guess I'll keep growing it.
Ah, no problem.
Let me just clean up the back here.
No, Mack, if you'd give me a couple of minutes.
Appreciate it.
I had this place built down here about 10 years ago.
I got tired of driving all the way across town every two weeks.
Now it's just an elevator ride.
Convenient.
You know what isn't convenient?
Cramming eight attorneys into my office.
It was not designed for the entire partnership of my law firm.
They're worried about Lanagin.
He's a little shaky, but he'll hold up.
Underwood?
Birch delivered.
And did Dunbar bring up Stamper?
The sessions are closed-door,
but I can't imagine she didn't.
And what about poor Havemeyer?
Was he any help to us on Jackie Sharp?
I do not take your hesitation as a promising sign.
I never like disappointing you.
He had nothing.
No.
Now, do you think that's because there's nothing here,
or because he's protecting her.
There's nothing there.
I can go to another congressman --
No, no, no.
It has to be somebody high-profile,
someone in the leadership who will make waves.
Let me get back to Birch.
Too obvious,
now that he's shown no sympathy for Frank.
This can't look orchestrated.
Multiple fronts, Remy.
Has to be Jackie Sharp.
Mack?
Let's finish up here.
I gotta get back to work.
You got it, boss.
You need to get back to work, too.
And what we discussed?
Make it happen.
You denied being a back channel.
I did not deny.
I chose not to confirm because it was classified.
But your office has consistently denied --
I instructed Doug to do so,
along with my communications department.
When a back channel becomes public,
it defeats its purpose.
An orchestrated deception --
If we had refused to comment,
it would have suggested that it was true,
which would have endangered the process.
I really had no choice.
Mr. Feng is currently in Dubai.
I know.
He's fleeing corruption charges.
Not the first time he's been accused.
And your question?
I know he laundered the money, Mr. Vice President.
It's just a matter of time
before I have the proof to substantiate that.
So my question, which I am asking again,
is whether you knew.
And I will repeat my answer.
I did not.
I did sense that something was awry,
and Doug was aware of my concerns.
And I took it upon myself to find out.
The vice president didn't know.
You had no knowledge he was going to the casino?
None. But that doesn't mean
I don't take full responsibility for my staff's behavior.
The buck stops with me.
And what did you find?
Nothing. No illegal activity.
I don't have the same resources that you do.
If you suspected,
why didn't you go immediately to the NIGC,
the BIA, the Department --
You have to understand.
We're facing very difficult midterms.
I didn't want to bring attention
to a series of allegations that may have no basis in fact.
Now, that may have been misguided logic,
but that's how I chose to act.
The mistake is mine and mine alone.
Not Doug's.
And certainly not the president's.
It shouldn't surprise you
if I say it feels like I am not getting the full picture.
Which is why I'm prepared to give you the full picture.
Oliver?
The White House believes in transparency.
All of the vice president's personal travel logs.
And the last 10 years since I became whip.
As well as the president's since inauguration.
There should be no doubt
as to whom we met with and when.
I am skeptical about what this contains.
Which is what we anticipated
and why Oliver will walk you through anything
you might need to know.
It's all there.
But if you have any questions or requests,
we'll be happy to facilitate.
I mean, at first I was really nervous.
But then as soon as I started getting into it,
starting speaking from my heart,
all these things poured out.
Everything I wanted to say.
That I've been wanting to say.
Seth told me that Matt was very impressed.
I want to do more.
More interviews?

Whatever it takes.
I want to help.
That's great, Megan.
Thank you for making me do this.
It was a big step for me.
You have a plane to catch.
I can stay longer, if you need me to do another.
Why don't you head back to Chicago,
and as soon as we put a plan together
we can give you a buzz?
Can I get a glass of water?
Tap is fine, or you want bottled --
I can get it.
We've got Ms. Hennessey's car ready, ma'am.
Edward?
Did she seem all right
when you picked her up from the airport?
How do you mean?
I don't know. Normal.
Yes. I'd say so.
She's very up and down.
Very skittish and manic.
I guess she did seem nervous.
We didn't talk much.
I'll get her.
I'll be outside.
Megan?
I've got it.
Really.
I'm okay.
The car is ready whenever you are.
Thank you for everything.
Have a safe flight.
I'll be in touch.
I just had a very productive interview with Ms. Dunbar.
Send out the press release.
Thank you very much.
You okay, ma'am?
Oh, I'm fine. I just dropped...
Please, let me.
Oh, uh, it's fine. I'm fine.
No, I've got it. You're barefoot.
Edward, you don't have to. Really.
Oh, no. What happened?
Damn it.
Let me get some bandages.
You don't have to.
No, I want to. Stay here.
The coverage has been mostly positive so far.
Dunbar's office?
All they've said is they look forward to reviewing the logs.
Any heat on Doug?
Some.
I'm getting a lot of requests for comments.
I acted on my own.
And I will fully cooperate with the Justice Department.
We can put that out?
Sir?
It might generate more interest.
On me. Not the vice president.
I can handle whatever comes my way.
Put it out.
I'll print you out the most recent clips, too, sir.
Should I find a way to tip off Dunbar?
Let nature take its course.
We got a hold of Remy.
He just got back to town.
Where is he?
I've arranged everything with your detail.
You've done good work, Doug.
Thank you, sir.
There. That's much better.
Thanks, ma'am.
I'm gonna get going.
I'm sorry I'm a little drunk.
It's your house.
You do whatever you want.
You should have a glass of wine.
I appreciate that, ma'am, but --
You're off your shift, right?
I am. That's true.
Then I won't take no for an answer.
Uh, you shouldn't waste any of your good stuff on me.
I don't really know anything about wine.
Then how about bourbon?
I bet you like a little of that.
I definitely don't mind a bourbon from time to time.
Then bourbon it is.
You're a tough man to track down these days.
You got the watch.
"To improve is to change."
"To perfect is to change often."
What sort of change are you looking for?
Whichever leaves me options.
Trouble at Glendon Hill?
Paid leave till the investigation is over.
Well, at least you're being paid.
First step in terminating my partnership.
You know how things go.
No matter what happens,
there's a stain I can't wash out.
So you're looking for career opportunities.
I'm not offering myself to you wholesale.
I keep fighting you,
but I can fight you less.
And by "less" you mean...
Enough to hurt, but not finish you.
And in return I have a future beyond Glendon Hill,
whatever that might look like.
So you offer neutrality,
but you'll go with the victor.
I figure let the best man win.
And if you go down,
it won't be because of me.
That's worth something.
Where is this coming from?
Insurance. That's all.
Does it have anything to do with Jackie?
That's over.
I know you've got Birch in your pocket.
Womack's not an option.
We're too close.
But Jacqueline...
This is about my future, pure and simple.
She's not a part of it.
Keep the watch, as a token of good faith.
He might deny it, but he's protecting her.
What he doesn't realize is
I have even less regard for Jackie than Raymond does.
Poor Remy.
The heart can choke the mind
when all its blood flows back unto itself.
He said, "I don't like brunettes."
Looks like I almost missed the party.
I'm off the clock, sir.
Oh, relax. Francis, I broke a glass,
and Edward cut his hand on a piece of it.
Jesus.
I have to change that.
Take that off, and I'll get fresh...
I hope you don't mind, sir.
I was off-duty --
Is she, uh...
Drunk? A little.
How many of these have you had?
A few.
More than a few.
May I?
Please.
Let me see.
Oh, it's not too bad.
There's a lot of blood.
Looks worse than it is.
Is it painful?
The bourbon helps.
Now you let me know if this hurts.
Not one bit, sir.
How's your head?
Fine.
Took a few aspirin before I went to sleep.
You?
I slept like a baby.
Good. You needed that.
What is it?
Something weird.
This one address keeps popping up.
Underwood?
The president.
Morning, Meechum.
Morning, Mr. Vice President.
It's a beautiful day.
